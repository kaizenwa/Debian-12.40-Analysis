## Debian 12.40 Analysis

This repository will be the basis for an informal Debian internals course where I dive into the
inner workings of the system from kernel boot, kernel initialization, and user-space
initialization.

These three stages aren't precise or anything; they were merely created for convenience.

The first two stages are self-explanatory, so I will explain the third stage in more detail.
First, I will cover systemd from a high level. Then, I will cover the initialization of the
desktop environment and the creation of the login prompt. From there, I will leave the rest
to everyone's imagination.
